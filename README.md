# JisstPCA
This repo is about algorithms and simulation of Joint-Integrated Semi-Symmetric Tensor PCA (JisstPCA), from the paper:

To run the code, you need to install tensor_toolbox by Kolda first, the link is https://www.tensortoolbox.org. To use functions, please download 'function' folder and use 'mkdir', 'addpath' command to add this toolbox into the path that can be applied in MATLAB

The folders in this repository are:

## Function

This folder contains all functions that we used in our empirical study: Main functions of our algorithms, baseline algorithms for comparative study, and other functions we used in the main functions.

## Example

In this folder, we present examples of all JisstPCA algorithms.

## Empirical

This folder contains the code of empirical study that appears in our main paper.
