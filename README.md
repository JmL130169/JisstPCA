# JisstPCA
This repo is about algorithms and simulation of Joint-Integrated Semi-Symmetric Tensor PCA (JisstPCA), from the paper:

To run the code, you need to install tensor_toolbox by Kolda first, the link is https://www.tensortoolbox.org. To use functions, please download 'function' fold and use 'mkdir', 'addpath' command to add this toolbox into the path that can be applied in MATLAB
