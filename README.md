# JisstPCA
This repo include functions for implementing the Joint, Integrative, Semi-Symmetric Tensor PCA (JisstPCA) algorithm, and code to reproduce the empirical results in the paper: Joint Semi-Symmetric Tensor PCA for Integrating Multi-modal Populations of Networks.

To run the code, you need to install tensor_toolbox by Kolda first, the link is https://www.tensortoolbox.org. To use functions, please download 'function' folder and use 'mkdir', 'addpath' command to add this toolbox into the path that can be applied in MATLAB.

The folders in this repository are:

## functions

This folder contains all functions needed for running the JisstPCA algorithm and its extensions, as well as integrated extensions of the HOSVD and HOOI algorithms.

## example

In this folder, we present examples of all JisstPCA algorithms.

## simulations

This folder contains the code for reproducing the empirical results in the paper.
