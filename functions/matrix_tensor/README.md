# Functions of matrix-tensor factorization

"imt_single": Single-factor matrix-tensor factorization, for $\mathcal{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$.

"imt_multi": Multi-factor matrix-tensor factorization, for $\mathcal{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$.

"imt_HOSVD": Integrated HOSVD for matrix-tensor factorization, by concatenate the matricization of the third mode at each iteeration.

"imt_HOOI": Integrated HOOI for matrix-tensor factorization.
