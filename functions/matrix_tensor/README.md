# Functions of matrix-tensor factorization

"JimtPCA": Main function of Joint-integrated matrix-tensor factorization, for $\mathcal{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$. The usage of "JimtPCA" and input arguements are similar to that of "JisstPCA" and "dJisstPCA".

"Jimt_single": Single-factor matrix-tensor factorization, for $\mathcal{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$.

"bic_msst": Return the value of BIC for given rank of $\mathcal{X}$.

"bic_mt": BIC deflation for rank selection of $\mathcal{X}$.

"imt_HOSVD": Integrated HOSVD for matrix-tensor factorization, by concatenate the matricization of the third mode at each iteeration.

"imt_HOOI": Integrated HOOI for matrix-tensor factorization.
